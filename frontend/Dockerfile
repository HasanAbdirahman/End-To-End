# Step 1: Use an official Node image to build the app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and install dependencies
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the app and build
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the app using a lightweight web server (nginx)
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy built React app from previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom nginx config (optional)
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80
